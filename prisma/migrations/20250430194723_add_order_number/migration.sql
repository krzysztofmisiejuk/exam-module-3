/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Order` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Order` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[orderNumber]` on the table `Order` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `orderNumber` to the `Order` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `orderId` on the `OrderItem` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
